					<h3>The more people want to participate in a meeting, the more problematic it gets to find a suitable time slot.</h3>
					We are aware of this problem and solve the nasty process of finding a date and make it super easy for you. Create a poll in a comfortable way, select data like start- and end time, as well as the location of the meeting and share your poll via a link with your participants, so they can mark their preferred dates.

					<h3>Include your calendar and filter out occupied timeslots.</h3>
					If you participate in a poll or create one, you can include your personal calendar to block timeslots that already have an appointment. We obviously do not share or use your private information for any other purposes, we will only use information about empty time slots from your calendar.

					<h3>The arriving time can be calculated</h3>
					LetÂ´s say the meeting is in another town, so you will also need time to get to the location the meeting takes place at. We solve this problem by calculating the estimated travel time for every participant.

			<h2>About us</h2>
			<p>Meetznow was created as a study project from students of software engineering and media computer science at the university of Stuttgart. Our motivation was to create a new innovative software for finding the best date for a meeting, that should also be easy to use. The core of Meeztnow is to simplify the planning of meetings even for more than 10 parties, where other tools like Doodle or Foodle are not as simple to use. This project was done at the summer semester 2018 at the institute of control technology for machine tools and manufacturing equipment (ISW).</p>
