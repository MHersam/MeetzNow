## How to use Express
Express is currently configured to serve a start website under localhost:3000 and our vue.js app under localhost:3000/app
You'll need a production build for our vue app (can be created with "npm run build")
Place the builds in their respective directory in /public (/startpage and /vueapp)
Last step is to run the Express server with "node app.js"
